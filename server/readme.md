I am creating this blog in a dynamic way as I intend to create a lot content.
If it was just one or two a week, then frontend would be fine; however since I am planning to post multiple times a day, static isn't feasible.

My tech stack would be,

- next.js for server side rendering
- nodejs/express as server
- mongodb as database (also considering postgresql, but not sure)
